-- TASK
-- Web_clickstream shopping cart abandonment analysis: For users who added products in
-- their shopping carts but did not check out in the online store during their session, find the average
-- number of pages they visited during their sessions. 
-- A "session" relates to a click_session of a known user with a session time-out of 60min.
-- If the duration between two clicks of a user is greater then the session time-out, a new session begins.

--IMPLEMENTATION NOTICE
-- The difficulty is to reconstruct a users browsing session from the web_clickstreams  table
-- There are are several ways to to "sessionize", common to all is the creation of a unique virtual time stamp from the date and time serial
-- key's as we know they are both strictly monotonic increasing in order of time and one wcs_click_date_sk relates to excatly one day
--  the following code works: (wcs_click_date_sk*24*60*60 + wcs_click_time_sk
-- Implemented is way B) as A) proved to be inefficient
-- A) sessionize using SQL-windowing functions => partition by user and  sort by virtual time stamp.
--    Step1: compute time difference to preceding click_session
--    Step2: compute session id per user by defining a session as: clicks no father apart then q02_session_timeout_inSec
--    Step3: make unique session identifier <user_sk>_<user_session_ID>
-- B) sessionize by clustering on user_sk and sorting by virtual time stamp then feeding the output through a external reducer script
--    which linearly iterates over the rows,  keeps track of session id's per user based on the specified session timeout and makes the unique session identifier <user_sk>_<user_seesion_ID>
