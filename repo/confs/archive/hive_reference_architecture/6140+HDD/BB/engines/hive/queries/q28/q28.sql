-- TASK
-- Build text classifier for online review sentiment classification (Positive,
-- Negative, Neutral), using 90% of available reviews for training and the remaining
-- 40% for testing. Display classifier accuracy on testing data 
-- and classification result for the 10% testing data: <reviewSK>,<originalRating>,<classificationResult>



-- This query requires parallel order by for fast and deterministic global ordering of final result
