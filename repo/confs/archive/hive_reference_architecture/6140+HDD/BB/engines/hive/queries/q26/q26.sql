-- TASK:
-- Cluster customers into book buddies/club groups based on their in
-- store book purchasing histories. After model of separation is build, 
-- report for the analysed customers to which "group" they where assigned

-- IMPLEMENTATION NOTICE:
-- hive provides the input for the clustering program
-- The input format for the clustering is:
--   customer ID, 
--   sum of store sales in the item class ids [1,15]




-- This query requires parallel order by for fast and deterministic global ordering of final result
