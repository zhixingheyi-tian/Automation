-- based on tpc-ds q74
-- Display customers with both store and web sales in
-- consecutive years for whom the increase in web sales exceeds the increase in
-- store sales for a specified year.

-- Implementation notice:
-- loosely based on implementation of tpc-ds q74 - Query description in tpcds_1.1.0.pdf does NOT match implementation in tpc-ds qgen\query_templates\query74.tpl
-- This version:
--    * avoids union of 2 sub-queries followed by 4 self joins and replaces them with only one join by creating two distinct views with better pre-filters and aggregations for store/web-sales first and second year
--    * introduces a more logical sorting by reporting the top 100 customers ranked by their web_sales increase ratio instead of just reporting random 100 customers
